# Git Hub Portfolio With ReactJS

This is my Github portfolio, designed to display all my git hub projects for my future employers.

    I wanted to show off my skills with react to any future employers as well as provide them my best projects so they can view my work.

    It takes all my big projects and puts them in one location in order to streamline the research and investigation steps of future employers.

    I learned how to use reactJS in order to disply new web pages dynamically. I also learned how to display images using react.
